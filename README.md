# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Model(MDPS)
The Multiple Disease Prediction System (MDPS) introduces an innovative approach to proactive healthcare management, harnessing machine learning techniques to anticipate the onset of various diseases. By enabling early intervention and preventive measures, MDPS has the potential to significantly improve public health outcomes and alleviate the burden of chronic illnesses on individuals and healthcare systems.

Project Overview

The MDPS project employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to predict multiple diseases in real-time. The project is structured into three main steps:

1.Model Training: Development of the predictive model using SVM algorithm. The model is trained on labeled data to learn patterns and relationships between input features and disease outcomes.

2.Input Acquisition: Utilization of a Kaggle data set to capture input data for prediction. This real-time input allows for seamless interaction with the model.

3.Prediction: Implementation of the prediction process using Streamlit framework. Users can give input data, and the model provides predictions on the type of disease the person may have.

Dependencies:-

Python

Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pickle)

Streamlit




# Multiple Disease Prediction System
